# ShiftSavior
Android App developed for CS50's Final project

Shift Savior is an Android app that I decided to make for the final project of CS50 2020. 
Inspired by my girlfriend who wanted an easy way to remind herself of her daily tasks as a nurse. 
Shift Savior is a reminder app that allows the user to create alarms that will remind them when to perform a task.

Shift Savior utilizes most of the concepts learned through the Android development track of this course. 
It uses the Android Room local database in order to store the user's created alarms. The app also utilizes certain phone functions such as notifications.
